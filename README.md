Wow just, what did I even just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Screamboat, right. Soaring suspense waves that definitely left me rattled, popcorn bits stuck in teeth—gross. Theater so cold, like sitting inside a refrigerator, damn. Okay, so first off, the  's splashy opening? Impressed. But wait, it’s like... the boat screams back when siblings scream, and it’s not that echo of despair but more like a whistling kettle? Rollercoaster. Thought I’d heard actual whales through the surround sound, or maybe it was just the old dude a few rows back snoring? Unclear.

The protagonist, that woman—did she ever blink?? Who designed her costumes, my grandma? Almost tripped over some popcorn boxes leaving, that old theater smell seeping into my jacket, gross again. Some kid behind me kept whispering about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , like sure, but how do you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 tension like that? What was his name? Leon? Liam? Gah, headphones are too tangled up in my coat pocket, who cares. 

> Can’t get over that one scene... pirates? A sail turned into a ghost cape, flapping and wailing. No, not a ghost cape, that's not right. But that's what it felt like. Maybe like a goose with a vendetta flapping madly, haunting the deck with a vengeance? Wouldn't recommend 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   on a stomach full of nachos.

Characters’ voices echoing like hollow bones, or maybe that’s just how bad the speakers were in this place. The boat itself, though, it was the real star, creaking and groaning like an old man tying his shoes. Why did every moan feel like an existential crisis? Just me or did I get shorter sitting in that seat for two hours?

Right, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you dare, I guess, but can it match the chilling crunch of $20 popcorn underfoot? Or was it just my back giving out... can’t tell. Oh, recommendation! 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with a friend who can explain nonsense to you. Or a dog who barks at shadows.

```python
def scream_boat(x):
    if x > ocean:
        return waves // screams
    elif x == popcorn:
        return crunch
    return boatghost # What even is this?!
```
